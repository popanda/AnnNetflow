	What we will need in Netflow export datagram:

	(my opinions are in brackets)
		
		a) IN HEADER
	bytes		
	0-1		1) version - of the NF export format  (V5)

	2-3		2) count - number of flows exported in this packet  
			
**	4-7		3) SysUptime - current time in miliseconds since the export device booted 
			(MO - miliseconds since our virtual machine isa2015 booted)
			
	8-11	4) unix_secs - Current count of seconds since 0000 UTC 1970 
	12-15	5) unix_nsecs - Residual nanoseconds since 0000 UTC 1970 
			(MO - there will be some function for storing these two values)
	
	16-19	6) flow_sequence - sequence counter of total flows seen
			(MO - stored from the 2009 project - number of flows seen since the virtual machine isa2015 boted)
	
	20 		7) engine_type - Type of flow-switching engine 			
	21		8) engine_id - Slot number of the flow-switching engine 
	22-23	9) sampling_interval - First two bits hold the sampling mode; remaining 14 bits hold value of sampling interval 
			(MO - also stored - unconflicted value = 0 - all of these three)


		b) IN FLOW RECORD
	bytes
	0-3		1) srcaddr - Source IP address 
	4-7 	2) dstaddr - Destination IP address 

	8-11	3) nexthop - IP address of next hop router 
	12-13	4) input - SNMP index of input interface 
	14-15	5) output - SNMP index of output interface 
			(MO - also stored - unconflicted value = 0 - all of these three)

	16-19	6) dPkts - packets in the flow 
			(MO - number of packed in this flow)

**	20-23	7) dOctets - Total number of Layer 3 bytes in the packets of the flow 
			(MO - maybe the value which we can see on softflowd?)

	24-27	8) First - SysUptime at start of flow 
	28-31	9) Last - SysUptime at the time the last packet of the flow was received
			(MO - times stored from pcap file - timestamp of first and last packet in particular flow)

	32-33	10) srcport - TCP/UDP source port number or equivalent 
	34-35	11) dstport - TCP/UDP destination port number or equivalent 

*	36		12) pad1 - Unused (zero) bytes 
			(MO - also stored - unconflicted value = 0)

*	37		13) tcp_flags - Cumulative OR of TCP flags 
			(MO - take all the flag vectors from all tcp packets and do OR on them)

	38		14) prot - IP protocol type (for example, TCP = 6; UDP = 17) 
	39		15) IP type of service (ToS) 
			(MO - could be stored from struct ip (maybe sth like ip_tos))

*	40-41	16) src_as - Autonomous system number of the source, either origin or peer 
*	42-43	17) dst_as - Autonomous system number of the destination, either origin or peer
*	44 		18) src_mask - Source address prefix mask bits 
*	45 		19) dst_mask - Destination address prefix mask bits 
*	46-47 	20) pad2 - Unused (zero) bytes 
			(MO - also stored - unconflicted value = 0 - all of these five values)
